# Readme

Crime is one variable that has a huge impact in people's life and to society in general. A [study from Iowa State University](https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2010/sep/costofcrime) says that a homicide costs around $17 million USD to society. The purpose of this project is making the crime data accesible to normal people for helping them decide better.

This repository includes all the source code for the Crime Analytics shiny app.
The source code is located in the [crime_shiny](./crime_shiny) folder in this repository.
